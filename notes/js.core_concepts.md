# Introduction To Javascript

Javascript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, and multi-paradigm.

Javascript is single-threaded, interpreted/JIT Compiled, Prototype-based, Mutli-paradigm, Dynamic, Weakly typed, and is a first-class function language with a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

### Explanation of Terminologies in JavaScript

#### High-level

A high-level language is one that is abstracted from the details of the computer hardware. It allows developers to write programs that are more understandable and closer to human language.

#### Interpreted

An interpreted language is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.

#### ECMAScript

ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript. It defines the core features and syntax of the language.

#### Dynamic

Dynamic languages perform many programming behaviors at runtime that static programming languages perform during compilation. This includes dynamic typing, late binding, and reflection.

#### Weakly Typed

In a weakly typed language, types are implicitly converted as needed. This can lead to unexpected behavior but allows for more flexibility in coding.

#### Prototype-based

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming where inheritance is performed via cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes.

#### Multi-paradigm

A multi-paradigm language supports more than one programming paradigm, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

#### Single-threaded

A single-threaded language executes one command at a time in a single sequence. JavaScript uses a single thread to execute code.

#### JIT Compiled

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a method of executing code that involves compilation during execution of a program – at runtime – rather than before execution.

#### First-class Function

In a language with first-class functions, functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

#### Non-blocking Event Loop

A non-blocking event loop allows JavaScript to perform asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread. This is achieved through callbacks, promises, and async/await.

#### Concurrency Model

JavaScript's concurrency model is based on an event loop, which allows it to handle multiple operations concurrently without multi-threading.
